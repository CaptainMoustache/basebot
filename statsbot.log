Nola, Aaron
Rodriguez, Eduardo
Time is running out for the Phillies, but if they want to keep their faint postseason hopes alive, they will need to start winning games that Nola starts. They are 0-4 the past four times he has pitched.
The lefty has emerged into the ace of the Red Sox this season. Rodriguez has been tremendous in his last three starts, going 4-1 with a 1.11 ERA. He is three wins away from reaching 20 for the season.

Waguespack, Jacob
Paxton, James
Waguespack was hit hard last time out, allowing six runs on seven hits over 4 1/3 innings against the Rays. Facing the Yankees, the big right-hander will look to go a full five innings for the first time since Aug. 22.
Paxton has won eight consecutive starts, going 8-0 with a 2.57 ERA since Aug. 2 while holding opponents to a .170 batting average. His curveball has been the key, using it more frequently to offset his fastball.
