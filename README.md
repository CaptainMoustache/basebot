# basebot
A baseball stats bot for discord

9/20/22 - Discord has updated how it requires the handling of messages and message content and Basebot does not adhear to these new requirements.
Basebot will cease operations on 10/1/2022.
I'll look into a possible rewrite in the offseason but there is a slim chance of that happening.
It's been fun :)
